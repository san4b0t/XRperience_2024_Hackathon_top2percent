Open the App on the mobile device


## Using the App

Hold your device out and steady for approximately 5 seconds.

Once planes are detected in the surrounding, tap any point on any plane to initiate a 3D model of a Heart on the point.

Use the Up and Down arrow buttons to move the model vertically up or down for customisable angles.

Move the device around the model to get a 360 view of the model.

Use the "Highlight" button while aiming at the part of the heart to highlight the model's component, getting the name of the component.

Use the "XRay" button to remove the outer layers of the heart, to show the inner workings and components.

Use the "Reset" button to reset the heart and place it in again using the earlier step.
